# Wayfaring Strangers

A game about constructed people, and their journey to become real.

## Pool of characters (like Circle of Hands)

## Towns with problems (like Dogs in the Vineyard)

## Endings and Fate (like The Drifter's Escape)

## Spent Fanmail as a currency for achieving milestones
## Relationships

Relationships use dice pools (of a fixed die size?). As the relationship
strengthens, you get more dice. If any 1s come up, there's a complication. More
intense relationships are necessary, but more likely to produce complications.
